The underlying idea

    1.  The ocr program takes a single black-and-white TIFF image (if you want
    many, run it in a script).  It identifies lines of text by finding
    horizontal empty regions.  Within each line it identifies glyphs by finding
    vertical empty regions.
    
    2.  Each glyph is converted to a vector of 25 real numbers in the range 0.0
    to 1.0 indicating the fraction of black cells in of 25 regions plus one more
    number pertaining to the aspect ratio of the glyph.  That number is the
    "signature" of the glyph.  The ocr program starts with a file (such as
    fontData/yiddishData) indicating the UTF-8 code for many signatures.  For
    each signature on the page, it finds the Euclidean nearest neighbor (using
    k-d trees). If that neighbor is close enough, it dictates the UTF-8
    translation of the glyph.

    3.  ocr.h taks some command-line parameters for various matters.

    4.  In interactive mode, you can move the scrollbars in the upper (showing
    the image) or lower (showing the OCR output) panes.  You may click on a
    glyph in the upper pane and look (in the middle pane) at its interpretation,
    and you may assign a new interpretation in the text box in the middle pane.
    You can write out the current font information with a button in the middle
    pane.

You need various libraries.  Here are the Ubuntu package names.

    libtiff4 libtiff4-dev libfribidi0

Look at the Makefile to get an idea of how to use ocr.  In particular, try

    make interactive

and also

    make batch

To train ocr on a new text, you need to fiddle first with the -w and -h
parameters so that small things like a pasekh are correctly seen, but noise on
the page is not.  Then (assuming your text is in Yiddish), make a copy of
fontData/yiddishData for your own text as a starting point.  Run ocr
interactively on a few pages until everything is recognized OK.  Then try it in
batch mode.
