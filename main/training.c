/*
training.c.

"Training data" associates glyphs (indicated by position of the
upper-left corner in the image file) with values (UTF8 strings).  It
does not involve the tuple representation.  Training data therefore
lets us redesign the tuple representation without losing training.
We don't store training data internally as such.  When we output
training data, we detect it by noticing glyphs whose tuples are found
in the categorization.  We can also read training data into a fresh
categorization.
